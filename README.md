Quick Guide: Recommendation Template
====================================

Follow the steps below carefully to complete your recommendation draft
using the provided LaTeX template.

------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Upload files to Overleaf
--------------------------------
- Go to https://www.overleaf.com
- Upload the entire file named:

      dataFromStudentForLOR.zip

Do NOT unzip the file before uploading. Overleaf will handle this
automatically.

------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Compile the project
---------------------------
- Open the file main.tex
- Click "Recompile" to view the generated document

This will show you a boilerplate example of how the final recommendation
letter is expected to look.

------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: Edit only the required files
------------------------------------
Modify ONLY the following three .tex files located in the folder:

      studentTexFiles/

These files are specifically designed for you to enter your information.

Important:
- Do NOT modify main.tex outside of the designated areas
- Do NOT edit any other files in the project

The first paragraph, last paragraph, and the signature block in main.tex
should NOT be changed. These sections are reserved for your recommender.

------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4: Using commands correctly
--------------------------------
When using any \newcommand defined in basicInfo.tex:

- Always add a trailing backslash (`\`) if a space is required after the
  inserted information.

Refer to the boilerplate examples in the student .tex files for correct
usage and formatting.

------------------------------------------------------------

Step 5: Review your draft
-------------------------
- Recompile the document after every change
- Carefully check for:
  - spelling errors
  - grammar mistakes
  - formatting issues
  - consistency of information

Ensure the document reads smoothly and professionally.

------------------------------------------------------------

Step 6: Submit the files
------------------------
- Once complete, please email the updated zip file to your recommender using their official office email address.

Do NOT remove or rename any files inside the project before submission.

------------------------------------------------------------

Notes
-----
- Follow instructions exactly to avoid formatting or compilation errors
- If something does not compile, undo recent changes and recheck syntax
- When in doubt, compare your edits with the provided boilerplate examples
